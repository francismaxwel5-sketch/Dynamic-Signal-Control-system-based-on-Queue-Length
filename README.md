# Dynamic-Signal-Control-system-based-on-Queue-Length
This repository implements a real-time, queue-length-based adaptive traffic signal control system using video analytics and edge computing. Designed for mixed-traffic suburban junctions, the model dynamically optimizes signal timings to reduce delay, queues, and emissions.
